      "\n",
      "4059) From a political and optics standpoint, this is the single best development yet in the January 6th probe. The mainstream media finally has its buzz phrase about this scandal (“seven hour gap”) and it’ll be repeated ad nauseum until the public just assumes Trump is guilty.\n",
      "\n",
      "4060)  I love the way you’ve phrased this. I don’t know how the media bosses decide what stories to over saturate us with but it sucks.    I’m so exhausted by the repetitive assisting of Trump. It’s baffling how he gets society to babysit and enable him from tip to tail.\n",

      "4061)  Find Don Trump jr lap top …Has Don Trump jr been held accountable for buying US secrets from Russian spies to use as dirt on Hillary? Huh?\n",

      "4064) Wild. “He wants us to make it wild😜.” How about illegal. “Prosecutors’ focus on one Trump tweet that inspired Jan. 6 insurrection hints at his culpability”  \n",
      "\n",
      "4065)  Klopt, Hubert. Aardig filmpje hier:   Maar uiteraard ging Trump daarna te keer tegen alles wat Obama vond, tijdens de exit-onderhandelingen. Gemengd beeld dus. Russische propaganda pikt de gewenste kersen.\n",
      "\n",
      "4066)  At least Biden isn't separating immigrants from their children and then have them deported without being reunited like Trump did. It's a shame your party doesn't see or care how traumatizing that is.\n",
      "\n",
      "4067)  Seems like the best they can do to come up with dirt about Joe Biden is through his son. But yet you can just look directly at what Trump did and continues to do and no Republican bats an eye\n",
      "\n",
      "4068)  Well first off that’s a flat out lie but the GOP only knows how to gaslight. Trump spent billions more than any other president and built less than 10 miles more of the wall than Obama did. He also deported less immigrants than all modern-day presidents put together. Trump failed\n",
      "\n",
      "4069)   Plus, I'd be shocked and disappointed if  endorsed him again.  That was a huge.   Undoubtedly, a large portion of the electorate took that to mean they could trust Bragg would be tough on Trump, which has since been proven to be a gross error of judgement.\n",
